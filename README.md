## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Inspector Firefox

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learnerd to improve my comprehension about inside element and ho to use th inspector to fix the problems.


### Continued development

I want to focusing on how to move or center element in space because i have some conflict sometimes with my flexbox.
and use less lines to achive the mission so i have to be more efficient with my code.
